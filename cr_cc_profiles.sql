It is called simply the \"dollar\" and the ISO 4217 currency code is USD. The central bank that issues the dollar is referred to as the <a href=\"http://www.federalreserve.gov/\" title=\"Federal Reserve Bank\">Federal Reserve Bank</a> and it has several locations throughout the United States. The dollar is used as a primary currency throughout the United States and its territories. It is the de facto currency for many regions around the world and it is the standard against which international currency is measured. As a form of money, the dollar can appear in paper or coin form. The most common form is paper with any American currencies being worth less than a dollar coming in the form of a coin.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The earliest minted US dollar that was used as currency can be traced back to 1792. Prior to that date, the American colonies used British currencies. The conversion to the American dollar was slow and difficult.</p>\n<p>The earliest dollars were minted coins that were very similar in look and feel to Spanish currency. The first dollar coins were made primarily of silver. The Coinage Act of 1792 actually described the US dollar as one-tenth the value of a type of currency called the Eagle. In the early days, American citizens required a reliable converter to help them understand the actual value of the dollar.</p>\n<p>The US dollar avoided having any images of American presidents on it until the very early 20th century. Some of the images used on early American dollars included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Greek and Roman mythological figures</li>\n<li>Generic images of native Americans</li>\n<li>Animals native to the United States</li>\n<li>Scenes such as ships in a harbor</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Prior to the establishment of the US dollar, the American economy was based on British shillings. The value of printed American colonial currency had a currency converter printed right on it that indicated how much the currency was worth in British shillings and pounds.</p>\n<h2>Facts</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The gold standard for backing the American dollar was first introduced in 1834</li>\n<li>The first paper money without the backing of the gold standard appeared in 1862. Paper was used because precious metal was scarce thanks to the Civil War.</li>\n<li>In 1933, President Roosevelt order all gold confiscated to try and salvage the gold standard and stabilize the value of the dollar in the face of the Great Depression</li>\n<li>The dollar is part of a list of denominations that includes bills worth two dollars, five dollars, 10 dollars, 50 dollars, 100 dollars, 500 dollars, 1,000 dollars, 5,000 dollars, 10,000 dollars and 100,000 dollars</li>\n<li>The two dollar bill is still legal tender in the United States, but the 5,000 and 10,000 bill have been discontinued because the larger bills made it easier for criminals to launder and traffic money</li>\n<li>The power for the United States government to make and distribute money comes directly from the Constitution</li>\n<li>The idea to put the images of presidents on the dollar started when George Washington was president. But Washington wanted to avoid using the same practices that the British had of putting sitting kings on currency, so Washington forbade any image of a living president from being put on currency. That edict is still followed to this day.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Nicknames</h2>\n<p>The US dollar is officially known as \"the dollar,\" but it has also gathered some colorful nicknames over time. Some of those nicknames include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buck</li>\n<li>Smacker</li>\n<li>Dead presidents</li>\n<li>Benjamins</li>\n<li>Jeffersons</li>\n<li>Bread</li>\n<li>Scratch</li>\n<li>Bones</li>\n<li>Buckos</li>\n<li>Dinero</li>\n<li>Cash</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Regions</h2>\n<p>The American dollar is legal tender anywhere in the world. But it is primarily used in the 50 states as well as the territories of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Other regions where the dollar is used as the primary currency include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>British Virgin Islands</li>\n<li>Turks</li>\n<li>Caicos</li>\n<li>El Salvador</li>\n<li>Panama</li>\n<li>Ecuador</li>\n<li>Northern Mariana Islands</li>\n<li>Guam</li>\n<li>American Samoa</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of the regions that unofficially recognize the American dollar as legal tender include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Afghanistan</li>\n<li>Bahamas</li>\n<li>Cambodia</li>\n<li>East Timor</li>\n<li>Lebanon</li>\n<li>Maldives</li>\n<li>Vietnam</li>\n<li>Marshall Islands</li>\n<li>Zimbabwe</li>\n</ul>', 1, 'Unites States of America', '$', 'Dollar', 0.25, 'Federal Reserve System', 'www.federalreserve.gov', '1/10, 1/100, 1/1000', 'cent', '1¢, 5¢, 10¢, 25¢', '$1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100'),

The Eurozone is a scattered collection of European countries that have all agreed to put resources behind a unifying government and a unifying form of currency. The Euro is a printed currency and it also comes in coin form. Its ISO 4217 code is EUR. It is issued from the <a href=\"http://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"European Central Bank\">European Central Bank</a> which is supported and administered by all of the countries that take part in the Eurozone. The Euro is rapidly replacing many of the regional currencies that had made European trade complicated. In some areas, the Euro has even taken on the name of the former regional currency. The Euro is circulated all around the world and is even the currency of choice for many African nations.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The way for the Euro was paved by the economic and political provisions made in the Maastricht Treaty which was signed in 1992 and unofficially established the Eurozone. When the 17 countries of the Eurozone finally agreed on a currency that would unify their economies, it became known as the Euro. The term \"Euro\" was said to be coined in a letter from European Commission president Jacques Santer dated August 4, 1995. The official term \"Euro\" was agreed to in a meeting of the European Commission in Spain on December 16, 1995.</p>\n<p>Each Eurozone country was given three years for the currency conversion to the new money. But the conversions were not easy and many areas experienced confusion as well as economic peril. The exchange conversion rates were firmly established by the Council of the European Union. The most recent currency to undergo the conversion from regional currency to Euro was the Estonian kroon. The converter rates for this currency were finally established on July 13, 2010.</p>\n<p>Since January 1, 2001, six currencies have converted from regional to the Euro. Those currencies are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Greek drachma &ndash; January 1, 2001</li>\n<li>Slovenian tolar &ndash; January 1, 2007</li>\n<li>Cypriot point &ndash; January 1, 2008</li>\n<li>Maltese lira &ndash; January 1, 2008</li>\n<li>Slovak koruna &ndash; January 1, 2009</li>\n<li>Estonian kroon &ndash; January 1, 2011</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Facts</h2>\n<p>Only 17 of the 27 countries recognized as being European participate in the Euro program.<br />In February 2012, it was determined that there are 890 billion Euros in circulation, which makes the Euro the largest currency in circulation in the world surpassing the United States dollar.<br />The Euro has been established as the second reserve currency of the global economy.<br />As of June 2012, the Euro is worth approximately $1.24 American dollars. This is the lowest value the Euro has seen and it is because of the financial problems in Greece and Spain.<br />It is estimated that approximately 330 million Europeans use the Euro on a daily basis.<br />The Euro is used by approximately 180 million people in other parts of the world which includes nearly 150 million users in the continent of Africa.<br />The European Central Bank is headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany.<br />On January 2, 2002, the European Central Bank announced that it would be teaming up with the national central banks of the Eurozone countries to distribute and administer the Euro currency system.<br />Each country has its own images on the back of the Euro coins. The front of the coin has the common Euro image, and there is a series of coins that have images significant to each of the countries of the Eurozone.<br />The denominations of the Euro include one Euro, two Euros, five Euros, 10 Euros, 20 Euros, 50 Euros, 100 Euros, 200 Euros and 500 Euros.<br />The currency converter the Euro in the international market makes it one of the strongest currencies in the world.<br />The Eurozone is recognized as the second largest economy in the world.</p>\n<h2>Nicknames</h2>\n<p>The Euro was used to replace the regional currencies that had existed for centuries. Because the financial nicknames had existed for so long, many locals refer to the Euro with the same nicknames given to the old regional currencies. Some of the Euro nicknames include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ege &ndash; Finland</li>\n<li>Quid &ndash; England</li>\n<li>Teuro &ndash; Germany</li>\n<li>Ouro &ndash; Galician</li>\n<li>Juro - Hungary</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Regions</h2>\n<p>The Euro is now the officially recognized currency of the 17 nations of the Eurozone.

This is the national currency of the country, as well as Cocos Islands, Christmas Island, Heard Island, McDonald Island, Norfolk Island, the Australian Antarctic Territory, Nauru, Tuvalu, and Kiribati. The currency is denoted with the dollar sign, and sometimes also with an A or AU to distinguish from other dollars that are used in currency. This currency was first used in 1966 as a replacement for the Australian pound, and is divided into cents much like the American dollar. The exchange code is AUD, which is used on exchange rate charts and in conversion.</p>\r\n<h2>History</h2>\r\n<p>The Australian dollar was not adopted until 1966, at which point it replaced the pound. The country has a rich history of currency, most of which involves using foreign currency from other countries until the turn of the 20th century when it was liberated. Before then, the country relied mostly on the British pound, which was the national accepted currency until 1910 when the Australian pound was introduced.</p>\r\n<p>The Commonwealth Bank was established in 1911 to support this currency, but this operation was difficult in the early years. With the addition of extra power and responsibility in the 1920s, Australia was able to reform its banknotes and improve its currency situation. The Reserve Bank of Australia was created in 1960, at which point preparations were made to introduce a new form of currency. There was controversy over the name of the Australian dollar, including a competition that was held to name the currency. It maintained a fixed exchange rate with the US Dollar until 1971, when the system collapsed and it became a moving peg before adopting the floating rate that it has today in 1983.</p>\r\n<h2>Regions</h2>\r\n<p>The Australian dollar is accepted as the legal tender in the entire country of Australia, as well as in many regions and islands surrounding the country. States and territories that use AUD include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Kiribati</li>\r\n<li>Nauru</li>\r\n<li>Tuvalu</li>\r\n<li>Christmas Island</li>\r\n<li>Cocos (Keeling) Islands</li>\r\n<li>Norfolk Island</li>\r\n<li>McDonald Island</li>\r\n<li>Heard Island</li>\r\n<li>The Australian Antarctic Territory</li>\r\n<li>Ashmore and Cartier Islands</li>\r\n<li>Coral Sea Islands</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Facts</h2>\r\n<p>The AUD is the sixth most popular currency in the exchange markets, beat out only by the US Dollar, Japanese yen, Euro, British pound, and the Swiss franc. This currency is involved in about 5% of foreign exchanges and Australia is known to have a very stable economy that makes its currency much more valuable than some countries. It is also the first of its kind to be based entirely on polymer bank notes, which gives it more credibility and value in the currency market. The currency is produced in many denominations, including coins of 5, 10, 20, and 50 cents as well as 1 and 2 dollar coins. The Reserve Bank of Australia also prints notes that are available in 5 values:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>$5</li>\r\n<li>$10</li>\r\n<li>$20</li>\r\n<li>$50</li>\r\n<li>$100</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Various colors and sizes are used to denote the denominations of the Australian dollar. The $5 note is pink/violet, the $10 is blue, $20 is orange, $50 is yellow, and $100 is a green color. The Reserve Bank of Australia is the regulating authority for this currency, which also monitors the Royal Australian mint and its production of currency.</p>\r\n<h2>Nicknames</h2>\r\n<p>The Australian dollar is symbolized as AUD, and in financial transactions the amount is sometimes marked as A$ or AU$ to distinguish this currency from other forms that also use the dollar. Nicknames for this currency include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Aussie</li>\r\n<li>Pacific Peso</li>\r\n<li>Moolah</li>\r\n<li>Pink lady ($5)</li>\r\n<li>Prawn ($5)</li>\r\n<li>Piglet ($5)</li>\r\n<li>Blue swimmer ($10)</li>\r\n<li>Heeler ($10)</li>\r\n<li>Lobster ($20)</li>\r\n<li>Pineapple ($50)</li>\r\n<li>Grey nurse (old $100 notes)</li>\r\n<li>Avocado ($100)</li>\r\n<li>Watermelon ($100)</li>\r\n<li>Peppermint ($100)</li>\r\n<li>Treefrog ($100)</li>\r\n</ul>', 1, 'Australia', '$', 'Dollar', 0.00, 'Reserve Bank of Australia', 'www.rba.gov.au', '1/100', 'cent', '5c, 10c, 20c, 50c , $1, $2', '$5, $10, $20, $50, $100'),

Its value is based primarily on its value in relationship to the American dollar. Just as with the American dollar, the Canadian dollar is broken down into increments of 100 called pennies. However, the Canadian government announced in 2012 that it will be phasing out the making of pennies and leaving the Canadian nickel as the smallest denomination still made. The ISO 4217 code for the Canadian dollar is CAD. It is issued by the <a href=\"http://www.bankofcanada.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bank of Canada\">Bank of Canada</a>. The symbol for the Canadian dollar is the familiar $ symbol. But if a distinction needs to be made between the Canadian dollar and any other dollar currency, then a C$ symbol is used.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The history of Canadian currency goes all the way back to the 1500s when the beginning of the colonization by the French and English. In the early days of Canadian currency, Native North American wampum and beaver pelts were considered to be currency. The value of each of these items as currency fluctuated from trading post to trading post.</p>\n<p>In the 1660s, the French government tried implementing a coin system in the new Canadian colonies, but the coins were all intercepted by merchants and used to buy British goods. The state of currency got so bad in Canada in the late 1670s that decks of playing cards were used to substitute for currency.</p>\n<p>Playing cards were used to pay soldiers working in Canada for several decades. The government official would write the amount that the card was worth on the back of the card, and it was then considered good currency. The practice was stopped in 1709 when soldiers started to get paid in deniers.</p>\n<p>Tokens and forms of foreign currency were used in Canada until 1821, when Canadian banks started to issue their own currency which was backed by gold and silver. In 1837, Canadian banks started to bring in metal tokens from England as a more durable form of currency. In 1851, the Canadian tried to institute a money system based on the sterling pound. But the currency converter with the rising American dollar made that difficult. In 1853, Canada adopted the gold standard and began basing its currency on the American dollar.</p>\n<h2>Facts</h2>\n<p>While Canada was moving in and out of the gold standard, regional currencies started to flood the Canadian economy. For example, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland both had their own coins in circulation for years that competed with the national currency.<br />The first Canadian coin was minted and circulated on January 2, 1908. The first coin was a fifty-cent piece made of silver.<br />The Canadian one dollar coin is known as a \"loonie\" because it has the image of a loon duck on it, and the two dollar coin is known as a \"toonie\" because it has two loons on it.<br />The Canadian government will often issue commemorative coins to recognize an individual or great event in Canadian history. With very few exceptions, these commemorative coins are issued as legal tender.<br />The Bank of Canada was opened in 1934. Prior to the Bank of Canada, the Canadian economy was run through such institutions as the Royal Mint, the Ottawa Branch of the Royal Mint and the Dominion of Canada.<br />It is rare to find the images of people on Canadian coins. The most popular images on Canadian coins include loons, maple leafs, beaver, caribou and moose. One of the few human images that do appear on Canadian coins is the Queen of England.<br />Canadian printed money often features political figures that are still alive. Even though Canada is liberated from England, some of the Canadian printed money still features images of the Queen of England.<br />In 1951, Canada issued a special nickel that commemorated the discovery of the nickel metal. At the time of issue, Canada was the source for a little more than 90 percent of the nickel metal found in the world.</p>\n<h2>Nicknames</h2>\n<p>There are few nicknames for the Canadian dollar. There are more nicknames for the other denominations than there are for the paper dollar itself.

Many people confuse the Swiss franc with the French franc, which had been legal currency in France for centuries. When France decided to join the Eurozone and adopt the currency known as the Euro, it stopped making French francs and discontinued the franc as a form of legal tender. This left the Swiss franc as the only franc being made and used in the world. Switzerland is not one of the 17 nations of the Eurozone. The ISO 4217 code for the Swiss franc is CHF. It is issued by the Swiss National Bank. The currency converter from the franc to the Euro shows that the Euro holds a slightly higher value than the franc. It has a sub-denomination of 1/100 that goes by several names including Rappen, centime and rap.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The Helvetic Republic is what brought order and rule to Switzerland in 1798. Prior to the Helvetic Republic, there were over 75 entities manufacturing and issuing currency in Switzerland. The result was nearly 900 different coins being circulated that had a different value from city to city. In 1798, the Helvetic Republic unified the Swiss currency using the French franc as a model.</p>\n<p>In 1803, the Helvetic Republic ended and so did its version of the franc. But the idea behind the franc remained in Switzerland for many decades. When the Helvetic Republic ended, the flow of different kinds of currencies started up again. Each region and, in some cases, cities within Switzerland started to mint their own currency. When the currency being brought in from foreign countries was taken into account, it was estimated that there were over 8,000 different kinds of coins being used as currency in Switzerland from 1803 to 1850.</p>\n<p>In 1848, Switzerland moved towards a policy of unity and adopted the Swiss Federal Constitution. In this constitution, it was stipulated that only the federal government was allowed to mint currency for Switzerland. To help develop a unified system of currency, the Swiss Federal Coinage Act of 1850 declared that the franc would be the official currency of Switzerland. As with the Helvetic Republic, this version of the franc would be based on the French franc with the Swiss franc being given sub-denominations of 10 batzen and 100 rappen.</p>\n<p>In 1945, Switzerland tied its franc\'s value to the value of the American dollar through the Bretton Woods system. The franc\'s value itself was tied to its composition of gold and silver. But the value on the international market is tied to the performance of the US dollar and the Euro.</p>\n<h2>Facts</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Despite popular international misconception, the Swiss franc is issued as a coin and on paper.</li>\n<li>Most people perceive the franc as only being a coin. This has not been true for a very long time.</li>\n<li>The Swiss franc can either be made up of 4.5 grams of silver or 0.290322 grams of gold.</li>\n<li>Unlike most currencies, the Swiss franc has several versions of the plural of its name.</li>\n<li>In some cases, the plural of the Swiss franc name depends on what country you are in. <span style=\"font-size: 15px; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.25;\">The most common plurals of the Swiss franc are:</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: circle;\">\n<li>Franken (German)</li>\n<li>francs (France)</li>\n<li>franchi (Italy)</li>\n<li>Rappen (German)</li>\n<li>raps (Romania)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>While the official ISO 4217 code for the Swiss franc is CHF, many international companies use the designation of Fr or SFr in their advertising and even in their accounting papers.</li>\n<li>The reason that the Swiss franc has been associated in popular culture with being a safe form of currency is because the franc has hardly ever been affected by inflation and it was protected by a Swiss law which stated that 40 percent of the value of all francs must be backed by gold. On May 1, 2000, the gold backing law was repealed and the Swiss sold off much of its gold. But the franc is still backed by 20 percent of its value in gold in Swiss bank vaults.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Nicknames</h2>\n<p>Because the Swiss franc is used by so many neighboring countries, it has developed a lot of nicknames.

It has been used as the official money on international trade for centuries and is one of the \"basket of world currencies\" that includes the US dollar, the Japanese Yen and the Euro. The official ISO 4217 code for the pound is GBP. It is issued only by the <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/Pages/home.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bank of England\">Bank of England</a> . There are several other currencies used around the world that are also referred to as a \"pound,\" but none of them are officially tied to the British sterling pound. The British pound can be split up into 100 smaller denominations known as pence. The singular of pence is penny, which is not related to the American penny.</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The \"pound\" gets its full name of \"sterling pound\" from the fact that its original value was determined by the value of one pound of sterling silver. It was devised when the Anglo-Saxons rules the British mainland and the pound remained intact when the Anglo-Saxons fell out of power.</p>\n<p>The earliest known use of sterling silver as currency can be traced back to the eighth century and King Offa. He had developed a currency system based on a silver penny, which was actually a derivative of the Frankish Empire\'s currency system. The currency converter from one silver penny to a pound came from the Carolingian system of currency which stated that 240 pennies equaled one pound. King Offa used 240 of his silver pennies to device the unit of currency known as the sterling pound.</p>\n<p>When the penny and pound was first introduced, the coins were made with the purest silver that could be found. But in 1158, King Henry II standardized this rather random purity system by stating that a sterling pound would always be 92.5 percent pure silver. The rest was filler metal. This was the standard used until the early 1900s when it was changed again.</p>\n<p>Sterling silver is the kind of silver used to make a 92.5 percent pure coin. Fine silver is a more valuable sort of coin that is made using 99.9 percent silver. The British found it easier to adhere to the sterling silver criteria and that is why the sterling silver pound became common.</p>\n<h2>Facts</h2>\n<p>The Bank of England was officially established in 1694. Almost from its very inception, the Bank of England was issuing paper money along with silver coins.<br />The value Scottish and Irish pounds are based on the sterling pound and that has allowed the British Isles to be able to do currency conversions for centuries.<br />The five pound, 10 pound and 20 pound notes are more commonly used than the one pound note.<br />The symbol for the sterling pound is £. It can appear with one or two lines through it. The central character in the pound symbol is the letter \"L\". This letter was used because the Roman word \"librae\" was used to measure currency in the ancient times.<br />The GBP symbol is sometimes mistakenly replaced with UKP. The GBP stands for \"Great Britain Pound\" and the UKP stands for \"United Kingdom Pound.\" The UKP symbol is incorrect because the United Kingdom includes Ireland and Scotland. Both Ireland and Scotland have their own version of the pound currency.</p>\n<h2>Nicknames</h2>\n<p>The nicknames used for the sterling pound have been around for centuries. Some of the nicknames refer to specific denominations of the pound, while other nicknames refer directly to the pound itself. Some of the more common sterling pound nicknames are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Quid</li>\n<li>Ster</li>\n<li>Stg</li>\n<li>Sterling</li>\n<li>Pence</li>\n<li>Farthing</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Regions</h2>\n<p>The sterling pound is the official currency of England as well as its direct territories. Those territories include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>British Antarctic Territory</li>\n<li>Falkland Islands</li>\n<li>Gibraltar</li>\n<li>Guernsey</li>\n<li>Isle of Man</li>\n<li>Jersey</li>\n<li>Saint Helena</li>\n<li>Ascension</li>\n<li>Tristan de Cunha</li>\n<li>South Georgia</li>\n<li>South Sandwich Islands</li>\n<li>British Indian Ocean Territories</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other countries that recognize and use the sterling pound include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uganda</li>\n<li>Zimbabwe</li>\n<li>Zambia</li>\n<li>Sierra Leone</li>\n<li>Tanzania</li>\n<li>Rwanda</li>\n<li>Malawi</li>\n<li>Botswana</li>\n</ul>', 1, 'United Kingdom', '£', 'Sterling', 0.00, 'Bank of England', 'www.bankofengland.co.uk', '1/100', 'penny', '1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1, £2', '£5, £10, £20, £50'),
